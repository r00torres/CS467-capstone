        /* In this example we used a different way to render the scene
        
        "This [as in animate()] will create a loop that causes the renderer to 
        draw the scene every time the screen is refreshed (on a typical screen 
        this means 60 times per second). If you're new to writing games in the 
        browser, you might say "why don't we just create a setInterval ?" The 
        thing is - we could, but requestAnimationFrame has a number of 
        advantages. Perhaps the most important one is that it pauses when the 
        user navigates to another browser tab, hence not wasting their precious 
        processing power and battery life."
